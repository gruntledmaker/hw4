          LOOPS

1.  the 'for' loops runs 38 times, for 38 positions of x between 10 & 390 following an increment of 10.

2.  the first 10 tells the base of the line to form 10 pixels from the left side of the canvas, the second 10
    tells the lines to stop forming once they're 10 pixels from the right side of the canvas, and the third 10
    designates the pixel-distance between the base of each line across the horizontal center of the canvas.
    
    
          ARRAYS
          
1. 10 times? Very unclear

2. All I can find is the Increment of 10 on Line 15.

3. By changing the x.slice values on 19 and 20 to a lower number, ex. -500 from -50
